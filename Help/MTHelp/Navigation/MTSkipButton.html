<P CLASS="Paragraph">The Mother Teres@ menu system is designed to force the
user to execute certain menu items in sequence to allow more detailed capturing
of patient data. The skip button is implemented to allow the user to skip
certain menu items. The items that can be skipped or not is fully programmable,
and the user will be able to change the items that can be skipped in the next
version.</P>
<P CLASS="Paragraph">Note: Click on the green icon if you want to capture
medical information in a specific toolbar item. Clicking on the yellow arrow
will skip that item and you can not go back. However, medical information can
be captured later on when you have finished all other items. </P>
