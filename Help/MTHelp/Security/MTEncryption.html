Decryption</P>
<P CLASS="Paragraph">The Mother Teres@ Database is encrypted using 64 bit
Blowfish technology. That means that the highly confidential data of your
patients is protected from intrusion by unwanted people. As you can see from
the above diagram, your dongle is needed to decrypt the data in the database.
Therefore, nobody can use your system without the dongle and your secret
password. This mounts up to a double protected system that is safer than your
bank system.</P>
