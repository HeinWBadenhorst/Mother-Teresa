Mother Teres@?</H2>
<P CLASS="Paragraph18pt">Mother Teres@ is a patient medical record keeping
system that has been designed in conjunction with a pulmonologist, with the
medical professional in mind. We know that the medical professional's time is
of the essence and therefore Mother Teres@ has been designed to require the
absolute minimum of typing while still allowing extensive capturing of patient
medical data. Examples of data readily available to the professional as
drop-down listbox items is :</P>
<UL>
<LI>Symptom List (Over 11000 symptoms)</LI>
<LI>Disease List (Over 1600 items).</LI>
<LI>Allopathic Medicine List (Same as MIMS.)(Over 2400 items.)</LI>
<LI>Surgery List (Over 1100 items)</LI>
<LI>Anatomy List</LI>
<LI>Country List</LI>

<P CLASS="Paragraph18pt">Mother Teres@'s design team decided to do away with an
extensive confusing menu system which is difficult to memorise. A colour-coded
toolbar system which forces the user to execute certain steps in sequence, was
developed. This allows the user to capture all the data needed for a patient
without having to memorise the menu system and it also results in more complete
patient data capture. Some toolbar items can be skipped if needed. The
capturing process was split up into two categories namely:</P>
<OL>
<LI>New Patient</LI>
<LI>Follow Up Patient.</LI>
